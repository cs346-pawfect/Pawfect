# Pawfect
## Overview 
This site is an intermediary between customers to adopt and offer their pets to other customers, where there is a list of the types of animals that are included from the seller, and the buyer can log in and adopt the pet he wants by choosing the type of pet he wants and contacting the seller to adopt the desired pet.
Where our site offers many options of animals such as birds, fish, dogs, cats and others.

In the near future, we aspire to add many other services, such as taking care of abandoned pets until you find people to adopt them, as well as selling pet supplies.
## Techniques
html, css, JS, bootstrap and mongoDB.
